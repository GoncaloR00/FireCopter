# Not done yet! The function of this node is to make the trajectory planning. A possible way to do this is to define
# some kind of trajectories when there are no fire detected. From the sonar_sensor node info we can make some kind of
# obstacle avoidance and from the fire_detection node info we can, for example, define the trjectory in order to put
# the centroid in the center of the image

# If there are the possibility to have more sensors (ex: Lidar), we can apply some kind of algorithm like A*
